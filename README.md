# Biosensors-ESP32-Mini
Wearable health-monitoring system built using ESP32-S2-Mini microcontroller. This project integrates multiple sensors (temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and ECG) to collect, process and trasmit signal in real time through serial communication. 

Sensors:

MAX30105 -> heart rate and SpO2 

BMP280 -> room temperature, altitude and pressure sensor.

SEN0213 (DFRobot ECG Sensor) -> Electrocardiogram
